# student-umbrella
Students, don't let your enthousiasm get rained on. This umbrella will (soon) cover all the material you need to be familiar with for a successful thesis at our lab

## Getting started

You can check out 
[this preliminary incomplete guide](https://github.com/dbbs-lab/student-umbrella/blob/main/figures_from_data.md) that concludes
with a set of exercises to make figures from datasets. Please write down all the steps you took to make things work, we can add them for other students.

If you get stuck anywhere, let us know and we'll help you out!
