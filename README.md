# student-umbrella
Students, don't let your enthousiasm get rained on. This umbrella will (soon) cover all the material you need to be familiar with for a successful thesis at our lab

## Getting started

Despite the announcement, the umbrella doesn't cover much yet, we're working on it whenever we have time. You can check out 
[this preliminary incomplete guide](https://github.com/dbbs-lab/student-umbrella/blob/main/figures_from_data.md) that concludes
with a set of exercises to make figures from datasets. Please record all the steps you took to make things work, 
we can add them for other that come after you! If you manage to get everything working and do the exercises, you're an absolute champion! 
Please contribute as much information as you can for others.

If you get stuck anywhere, let us know and we'll help you out!
