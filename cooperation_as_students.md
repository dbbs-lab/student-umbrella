When going through the guides and exercises your fellow students will be your most excellent resource!

Reward them properly üçª

* If anyone helped you with certain exercises or concepts, mention them and their contribution in a
  comment. It will be good for their reputation ‚ù§Ô∏è
* If anyone shared their code with you, you are free to use that code, just leave a start and end
  comment around the copied code and describe how you modified it, and why you needed it (even if
  that is simply because you wanted to skip that part, that's fine!).

If you don't mention that someone helped you I will get annoyed and suspicious when I read through code
that I've seen before, or when you later fail to understand a problem you had solved in "your" exercises.
Starting from an example is an amazing way to learn, I'd just like to know that I can skip over copied
code while reviewing üòä

* Ask your questions in a public place where they can be easily found, answered and read by others.
* Organize student lectures and tutorings, fill in the gaps where required and let me know so I can
  adjust the material.
