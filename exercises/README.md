## Playground rules

Questions here are formulated very literally, to reflect the strictness of coding, and the
obtuse way that your code will be interpreted by the machine. In case of confusion,
interpret the question as literally as possible. The only restrictions to an answer are
those set out by the question.

Question: Create `5`

Answer: `5`

When the code "5" is executed in Python, the value `5` is created by Python, so the answer
is correct. `1+1+1+1+1` is also correct. Clearly there exist a trivial set of solutions,
give me either the shortest, or funniest, you can think of.

Since we're doing these exercises for educational purposes, a clear exception is when the
answer does not convincingly cover the question or demonstrate understanding of the matter:

Question: Give me the division of `3` by `1.5`

Answer: `2`

Forgive me! ðŸ˜‡ I should have asked to "Use the division operator to give me the division
of `3` by `1.5`"

## Solving exercises

To solve a set of exercises create a file with the same name as the file, give it a `.py`
extension. Every exercise has a number associated with it, and sometimes a section letter.
Insert a comment line with the section and number above your code answer, and a blank line
after it:

```python
# A1:
5 + 3

# A2:
print("hello")

# A3:
set([3])
```

If a section of questions has small answers, like above, you can answer them all in 1:

```python
# A:
5 + 3
print("hello")
set([3])
```

Some exercises are *instructions*, they end with a `.` and ought to be answered strictly
in Python code, as above. Exercises that end with a question mark are *questions*, answer
them as a comment:

```python
# A1:
# There once was a person from Perth. They didn't understand how limericks worked. They
# wrote it all down, there followed a frown. Limericks are hard.
```

If a question is marked `(tricky)`, take a deep breath and see if you can combine the
tools you have into an inventive answer. If not, move on, or see if Google can help you.
They're intended as brain teasers ðŸ˜€
